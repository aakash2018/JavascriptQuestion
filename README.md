86. Check if a Number is Armstrong
87. Binary Search
Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an
integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then
return its index. Otherwise, return -1.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:

- Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
- Output: 4

88. Find the Duplicate Number
Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer
is in the range [1, n] inclusive.
There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.
You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only
constant extra space.

Example 1:

- Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
- Output: 2

89. Search Insert Position
Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if
the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted
in order.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:

- Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
- Output: 2

90. Sort Colors
Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-
place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the
order red, white, and blue.
We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue,
respectively.
You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

Example 1:

- Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
- Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

91. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array
Given an array of integers nums sorted in non-decreasing order, find the
starting and ending position of a given target value.
If target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:

- Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
- Output: [3,4]

92. Length of Last Word
Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last
word in the string.
A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

Example 1:

- Input: s = "Hello World"
- Output: 5

93. Set Matrix Zeroes
Given an m x n integer matrix matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and
column to 0's.
You must do it in place.

Example 1:

- ![set matrix zero](setmatrixzero.png)
- Input: matrix = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
- Output: [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]

94. Pascal's Triangle
Given an integer numRows, return the first numRows of Pascal's triangle.
In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly
above it as shown:

Example 1:

- Input: numRows = 5
- Output: [[1],[1,1],[1,2,1],[1,3,3,1],[1,4,6,4,1]]

95. Single Element in a Sorted Array
You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element
appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once.
Return the single element that appears only once.
Your solution must run in O(log n) time and O(1) space.

Example 1:

- Input: nums = [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]
- Output: 2

96. Search a 2D Matrix
You are given an m x n integer matrix matrix with the following two properties:

- Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the
previous row.
Given an integer target, return true if target is in matrix or false otherwise.
You must write a solution in O(log(m * n)) time complexity.

Example 1:

- ![2d matrix](2dmatrix.png)
- Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 3
- Output: true

97. Pow(x, n)
Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n (i.e., xn).

Example 1:

- Input: x = 2.00000, n = 10
- Output: 1024.00000

98. Find a Peak Element II
A peak element in a 2D grid is an element that is strictly greater than all of
its adjacent neighbors to the left, right, top, and bottom.
Given a 0-indexed m x n matrix mat where no two adjacent cells are equal,
find any peak element mat[i][j] and return the length 2 array [i,j].
You may assume that the entire matrix is surrounded by an outer perimeter
with the value -1 in each cell.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(m log(n)) or O(n log(m)) time.

Example 1:

![peak element](peak_element.png)

- Input: mat = [[1,4],[3,2]]
- Output: [0,1]

99. Max Value of Equation
You are given an array points containing the coordinates of points on a 2D
plane, sorted by the x-values, where points[i] = [xi, yi] such that xi < xj for all 1
<= i < j <= points.length. You are also given an integer k.
Return the maximum value of the equation yi + yj + |xi - xj| where |xi - xj| <= k
and 1 <= i < j <= points.length.
It is guaranteed that there exists at least one pair of points that satisfy the
constraint |xi - xj| <= k.

Example 1:

- Input: x = [[1,3],[2,0],[5,10],[6,-10]], k = 1, n = 1
- Output: 4

100. Jump Game
You are given an integer array nums. You are initially positioned at the
array's first index, and each element in the array represents your maximum
jump length at that position.
Return true if you can reach the last index, or false otherwise.

Example 1:

![jumpgame](jump_game.png)

- Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
- Output: true

101. Remove Outermost Parentheses

A valid parentheses string is either empty "", "(" + A + ")", or A + B, where A and
B are valid parentheses strings, and + represents string concatenation.
For example, "", "()", "(())()", and "(()(()))" are all valid parentheses strings.
A valid parentheses string s is primitive if it is nonempty, and there does not
exist a way to split it into s = A + B, with A and B nonempty valid parentheses
strings.
Given a valid parentheses string s, consider its primitive decomposition: s =
P1 + P2 + ... + Pk, where Pi are primitive valid parentheses strings.
Return s after removing the outermost parentheses of every primitive string
in the primitive decomposition of s.

Example 1:

- Input: s = "(()())(())"
- Output: "()()()"

102. Integer to Roman
Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D
and M.

![Image](romanimage.png)

- For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added
    together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written
    as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.
    Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right.
    However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as
    IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same
    principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six
    instances where subtraction is used:
        - I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.
        - X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.
        - C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
        - Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.

Example 1:

- Input: num = 3
- Output: "| | |"
