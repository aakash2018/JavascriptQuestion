# Node.js Interview Questions & Answers (Hindi & English, Deep Explanation)

## 1. Explain the event loop in Node.js (imp)?

**English:**
The event loop is the core mechanism in Node.js that enables non-blocking, asynchronous operations. Node.js runs on a single thread, but thanks to the event loop, it can handle many concurrent operations efficiently. The event loop continuously checks the call stack and the callback queue. When the call stack is empty, it picks the next callback from the queue and pushes it onto the stack for execution. This allows Node.js to handle I/O operations (like reading files, network requests) without blocking the main thread.

**Analogy:**
Imagine a chef (Node.js) who takes orders (callbacks) and puts them in a queue. The chef finishes one dish (task) and then picks the next order from the queue, ensuring the kitchen (main thread) is never idle.

**Hindi:**
Event loop Node.js ka core mechanism hai jo non-blocking, asynchronous operations ko possible banata hai. Node.js ek single thread par chalta hai, lekin event loop ki wajah se yeh ek sath kai operations efficiently handle kar sakta hai. Event loop call stack aur callback queue ko continuously check karta hai. Jab call stack khali hota hai, toh event loop callback queue se next callback uthata hai aur stack par execute karta hai. Isse Node.js bina main thread ko block kiye I/O operations (file read, network request) handle kar sakta hai.

**Tulanatmak Udaharan:**
Sochiye ek chef (Node.js) hai jo orders (callbacks) queue me rakhta hai. Chef ek dish (task) complete karta hai, fir queue se agla order uthata hai, is tarah kitchen (main thread) kabhi idle nahi hota.

## 2. Explain the internal architecture of Node.js?

**English:**
Node.js is built on the V8 JavaScript engine (the same engine used in Google Chrome). Its architecture consists of:
- **Single-threaded Event Loop:** Handles all requests and delegates heavy tasks to background workers.
- **Libuv:** A C library that provides the event loop, thread pool, and asynchronous I/O.
- **C++ Bindings:** Allow Node.js to interact with system-level APIs.
- **APIs:** Built-in modules (fs, http, etc.) for file system, networking, etc.
- **Event-driven, Non-blocking I/O:** All I/O operations are asynchronous, making Node.js highly scalable.

**Hindi:**
Node.js V8 JavaScript engine par bana hai (jo Google Chrome me bhi use hota hai). Iski architecture me yeh cheezein hoti hain:
- **Single-threaded Event Loop:** Sabhi requests handle karta hai aur heavy tasks ko background workers ko deta hai.
- **Libuv:** Ek C library hai jo event loop, thread pool, aur asynchronous I/O provide karti hai.
- **C++ Bindings:** Node.js ko system-level APIs se interact karne dete hain.
- **APIs:** Built-in modules (fs, http, etc.) file system, networking ke liye.
- **Event-driven, Non-blocking I/O:** Sabhi I/O operations asynchronous hote hain, isliye Node.js highly scalable hai.

## 3. What is npm and list out the uses of it.

**English:**
npm (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js. It allows developers to install, share, and manage third-party libraries (packages) and their dependencies. Uses of npm:
- Install packages (`npm install package-name`)
- Manage project dependencies
- Publish and share your own packages
- Run scripts (build, test, start)
- Version control for packages

**Hindi:**
npm (Node Package Manager) Node.js ka default package manager hai. Yeh developers ko third-party libraries (packages) aur unke dependencies install, share, aur manage karne deta hai. npm ke uses:
- Packages install karna (`npm install package-name`)
- Project dependencies manage karna
- Apne khud ke packages publish/share karna
- Scripts run karna (build, test, start)
- Packages ke version control karna

## 4. What are the different phases of event loop (imp)?

**English:**
The event loop in Node.js has several phases:
1. **Timers:** Executes callbacks scheduled by setTimeout and setInterval.
2. **Pending Callbacks:** Executes I/O callbacks deferred to the next loop.
3. **Idle, Prepare:** Internal use only.
4. **Poll:** Retrieves new I/O events; executes I/O-related callbacks.
5. **Check:** Executes setImmediate callbacks.
6. **Close Callbacks:** Executes close event callbacks (e.g., socket.on('close')).

**Hindi:**
Node.js ke event loop me kai phases hote hain:
1. **Timers:** setTimeout aur setInterval ke callbacks execute karta hai.
2. **Pending Callbacks:** I/O callbacks jo next loop ke liye defer hue hain.
3. **Idle, Prepare:** Internal use ke liye.
4. **Poll:** Naye I/O events leta hai; I/O callbacks execute karta hai.
5. **Check:** setImmediate ke callbacks execute karta hai.
6. **Close Callbacks:** Close event ke callbacks execute karta hai (jaise socket.on('close')).
