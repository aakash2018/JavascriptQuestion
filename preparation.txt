//Recently, I gave multiple interviews for Senior React.js & Tech Lead roles — here are the Top 10 most common questions I was asked.
//  These are basic-level but frequently asked in interviews 👇

// 1️⃣ Call, Apply, and Bind
//  Difference between them + write a polyfill.

// 2️⃣ Flatten Array (No Array.flat)
//  Input : [1,2,3,[4,5,6,[7,8,[10,11]]],9] 
//  Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,11,9]

// 3️⃣ Inline 5 divs in a row without flex/margin/padding
//  (Hint: display: inline-block)

// 4️⃣ Find sum of numbers without for loop
//  Input: [1,2,3,4,5] — (Hint: reduce() or recursion)

// 5️⃣ Deep Copy vs Shallow Copy (How to achieve this)
//  const a = { ab: { cd: { ef: true } } };
//  const b = a; const c = { ...a };
//  console.log(a === b); console.log(a === c);
//  a.ab.cd.ef = false;
//  console.log(b.ab.cd.ef); console.log(c.ab.cd.ef); 

// 6️⃣ Promise & Async/Await Output (More questions I will be posting later) 
//  async function chart(v){ 
//  console.log("start", v); 
//  await console.log("middle", v); 
//  console.log("end", v);
//  }
//  chart("first"); 
//  chart("second");

// 7️⃣ Find first repeating character
//  Example: "success" → c

// 8️⃣ Implement a Stopwatch
//  Start, Stop, Reset + live display.

// 9️⃣ Build a To-Do List (Vanilla JS or React)
//  Follow-up: How would you optimize re-renders?

// 🔟 Currying Function for Infinite Sum.
//  sum(10)(20)(30)() Output => 60
//  sum(10)(20)(30)(40)(50)(60)() Output => 210

// During my 2-month job hunt, I interviewed with a remote-first product company for a Senior React Developer role. The process was challenging, insightful, and full of learnings — even though the final verdict was rejected.

// Here’s how it went:

// 🎯 Round 1 (JavaScript + Problem Solving)
// 👉 Next.js Page Router basics
// 👉 Implemented a once function (runs only once)
// 👉 Wrote a curried sum function → sum(1)(2)(3)...()
// 👉 Flattened a deeply nested object into key-value pairs

// 🎯 Round 2 (System + Frontend Design)
// 👉 Built a Redux clone from scratch
// 👉 Designed a syntax highlighter (similar to regex101)
// 👉 High-level design for Reddit comments

// 🎯 Round 3 (Product/Behavioral)
// 👉 Expected a product sense round, but it turned into a deep dive into my past projects
// 👉 Shared my previous work, though I wasn’t entirely sure what the interviewer was trying to evaluate

// ✅ Use unique id as key
// ✅ Avoid using index unless no other option


// ---

// 🔹 Q7. User uploads a profile pic but still sees the old image. Why?

// ✅ Update local state immediately


// ---

// 🔹 Q8. A modal popup opens, but clicking outside doesn’t close it. How do you fix it?
// ✅ Add onClick outside handler
// ✅ Provide visible close (X) button


// ---

// 🔹 Q9. A button inside a form is refreshing the page unexpectedly. How do you stop it?
// ✅ Add event.preventDefault()
