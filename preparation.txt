//Recently, I gave multiple interviews for Senior React.js & Tech Lead roles — here are the Top 10 most common questions I was asked.
//  These are basic-level but frequently asked in interviews 👇

// 1️⃣ Call, Apply, and Bind
//  Difference between them + write a polyfill.

// 2️⃣ Flatten Array (No Array.flat)
//  Input : [1,2,3,[4,5,6,[7,8,[10,11]]],9] 
//  Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,11,9]

// 3️⃣ Inline 5 divs in a row without flex/margin/padding
//  (Hint: display: inline-block)

// 4️⃣ Find sum of numbers without for loop
//  Input: [1,2,3,4,5] — (Hint: reduce() or recursion)

// 5️⃣ Deep Copy vs Shallow Copy (How to achieve this)
//  const a = { ab: { cd: { ef: true } } };
//  const b = a; const c = { ...a };
//  console.log(a === b); console.log(a === c);
//  a.ab.cd.ef = false;
//  console.log(b.ab.cd.ef); console.log(c.ab.cd.ef); 

// 6️⃣ Promise & Async/Await Output (More questions I will be posting later) 
//  async function chart(v){ 
//  console.log("start", v); 
//  await console.log("middle", v); 
//  console.log("end", v);
//  }
//  chart("first"); 
//  chart("second");

// 7️⃣ Find first repeating character
//  Example: "success" → c

// 8️⃣ Implement a Stopwatch
//  Start, Stop, Reset + live display.

// 9️⃣ Build a To-Do List (Vanilla JS or React)
//  Follow-up: How would you optimize re-renders?

// 🔟 Currying Function for Infinite Sum.
//  sum(10)(20)(30)() Output => 60
//  sum(10)(20)(30)(40)(50)(60)() Output => 210

// During my 2-month job hunt, I interviewed with a remote-first product company for a Senior React Developer role. The process was challenging, insightful, and full of learnings — even though the final verdict was rejected.

// Here’s how it went:

// 🎯 Round 1 (JavaScript + Problem Solving)
// 👉 Next.js Page Router basics
// 👉 Implemented a once function (runs only once)
// 👉 Wrote a curried sum function → sum(1)(2)(3)...()
// 👉 Flattened a deeply nested object into key-value pairs

// 🎯 Round 2 (System + Frontend Design)
// 👉 Built a Redux clone from scratch
// 👉 Designed a syntax highlighter (similar to regex101)
// 👉 High-level design for Reddit comments

// 🎯 Round 3 (Product/Behavioral)
// 👉 Expected a product sense round, but it turned into a deep dive into my past projects

🔹 React.js Interview Questions

1. Basics
Q: What are components in React?
 A: Components are independent, reusable pieces of UI. They can be functional or class-based.
Q: What is JSX?
 A: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks like HTML and is used to describe UI elements in React. It is transpiled into React.createElement.
2. State & Props
Q: Difference between state and props?
 A:
State → managed inside a component, mutable.
Props → passed from parent, read-only.
Q: Can you modify props inside a component?
 A: No, props are immutable. Only the parent can update them.
3. Hooks
Q: What does useEffect do?
 A: Handles side effects (API calls, subscriptions, timers) in functional components.
Q: Difference between useMemo and useCallback?
 A:
useMemo → caches computed values.
useCallback → caches function references.
4. Performance
Q: How do you prevent unnecessary re-renders?
 A:
Use React.memo for components.
Use useCallback and useMemo.
Key lists properly.
Q: What is code splitting in React?
 A: Breaking bundles into smaller chunks (via React.lazy & Suspense) for faster load time.
5. Advanced
Q: What are controlled vs uncontrolled components?
 A:
Controlled → form inputs managed by React state.
Uncontrolled → managed by the DOM (using ref).
Q: How does React Fiber differ from older versions?
 A: React Fiber introduced incremental rendering and better scheduling for smoother UI updates.

🔹 JavaScript Interview Questions
1. Core Concepts
Q: What is the difference between let, var, and const?
 A:
var → function-scoped, hoisted.
let → block-scoped, not hoisted.
const → block-scoped, cannot be reassigned.
Q: Explain event delegation.
 A: Attaching a single event listener to a parent element that handles events from its children via event bubbling.
2. Async
Q: Difference between callbacks, promises, and async/await?
 A:
Callbacks → nested, harder to manage (callback hell).
Promises → better handling, .then & .catch.
Async/Await → syntactic sugar over promises, cleaner code.
Q: What is the event loop?
 A: A mechanism that handles async operations in JS by pushing callbacks from the task queue to the call stack.
3. Objects & Functions
Q: Difference between shallow copy and deep copy?
 A:
Shallow copy → copies only references (e.g., Object.assign, spread operator).
Deep copy → copies nested objects too (e.g., structuredClone).
Q: Explain call, apply, and bind.
 A:
call → invoke with arguments individually.
apply → invoke with arguments as an array.
bind → returns a new function with fixed this.

⚛️ React Interview Question: What will be the count value here?

function Counter() {
 const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

 function increment() {
 setCount(count + 1);
 setCount(count + 1);
 }

 return <button onClick​={increment}>{count}</button>;
}

👉 After clicking once, count = 1, not 2.

✅ Reason:
React batches state updates.
Both setCount(count + 1) use the same stale value of count (0).
Final update = 1.

💡 Use functional updates to fix:
setCount(c => c + 1);
setCount(c => c + 1);

Output → 2 🎯
